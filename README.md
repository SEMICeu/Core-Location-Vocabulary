## Core Location Vocabulary (CLV) <img align="right" src="/semic-icon-small.png" alt="SEMIC Core Vocabulary" />  

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Location Vocabulary.

The Core Location Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry.

The current version of the Core Location Vocabulary is [2.1.0](https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Location-Vocabulary/releases/2.1.0/).

This specification was produced by the Core Vocabularies Working Group (Location Task Force), following the Process and Methodology for Developing Core Vocabularies, [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies). It has been reviewed by representatives of the Member States of the European Union, PSI publishers, and by other interested parties. On 23 May 2012, the Member State representatives in the ISA Coordination Group have endorsed the Core Location vocabulary v1.00, acknowledging the work and promising to further disseminate it at national level. 

Any problems encountered, or suggestions for new functionalities can be submitted as issues on the Core Location Vocabulary repository on GitHub. A short guideline for submitting issues can be found at [https://github.com/SEMICeu/Core-Location-Vocabulary/wiki](https://github.com/SEMICeu/Core-Location-Vocabulary/wiki).
