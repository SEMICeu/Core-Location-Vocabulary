# Core Location Vocabulary

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Location Vocabulary.

The Location Core Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a location represented as an address, a geographic name, or a geometry.

This specification was produced by the Core Vocabularies Working Group (Location Task Force), following the Process and Methodology for Developing Core Vocabularies, https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies. It has been reviewed by representatives of the Member States of the European Union, PSI publishers, and by other interested parties. On 23 May 2012, the Member State representatives in the ISA Coordination Group have endorsed the Core Person vocabulary v1.00, acknowledging the work and promising to further disseminate it at national level. 

The current version of the Core Location Vocabulary can be downloaded from https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Location-Vocabulary/releases/2.00/.

Discussions about the version 2.0.0 of Core Location took place during the webinar of the 20th of May 2021[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg70I5q6uPI]

Any problems encountered, or suggestions for new functionalities can be submitted as issues on the Core Location Vocabulary repository on GitHub. A short guideline for submitting issues can be found at https://github.com/SEMICeu/Core-Location-Vocabulary/wiki.
